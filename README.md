# Prediction-Project

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The goal of my project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I should create a report describing how I built my model, how I used cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices that I did.
